Hey, do you remember the encryption code for our employee
files?
						
To: Sally Stark
Why do you want to know? And hey, how about dinner tonight?

From: Sally Stark
I told you, Steve! We're over! Now just tell me the code!!

To: Sally Stark
It's against policy to say! You're a receptionist! why the
hell would you want to know the code?! Only Security Consultants
would want to know that.

From: Sally Stark
It's to help a cute new employee! He forgot it and I want to look smart so
I can ride him!! Cuz i know he'll be better than you!! Now
if you don't tell me I'LL TELL EVERYONE ABOUT YOUR FETISH!!

To: Sally Stark
FUUUCK! OKay bitch! I can't tell you directly but its the
amount of RAM on your computer. Its on the sticker on your
computer you dumb bitch.
P.S. I hope he gives you the AIDS.

Hey, Sal. I need a big favor from you! I need to take my

To: Tyrella Jensen
No problem, I hope he gets better because I know you love your little boy.
						
To: Richard Moliere
Remember me? It's Sally, the receptionist. I just wanted to say
that I found out the code for you. It's 8.

From: Richard Moliere
Thank you so much, ma'am. You are a life saver. It would be
so embarrassing to ask for such important information from my
boss. Especially right after he just told me. So, thanks again.

To: Richard Moliere
No problem. And what's with the ma'am stuff? Just call me Sally."

Haha okay Sally. The code you gave me worked for most of the files
except for one. I don't know what the file does, I'll ask my boss.

To: Amitav Gutipaty
I'm sorry to disturb you but I have a file here sitting on my computer.
I can't open it with our current encryption code. Do you know how to
decrypt it?

From: Amitav Gutipaty
No.

To: Amitav Gutipaty
So, do I just leave it alone?

From: Amitav Gutipaty
Yes.

Things to remember:
1. The decryption code for our files is 8.
But when security is comprimised it turns into the opposite plus the ram contained.
Then the network will re-arrange itself. Which means some computers will not be hooked up.
But some others will.
						
2. I was told not to mess that wierd savedFragment file.
						
3. Call Sally by her first name...even though she's like 20 years older than me.
						
4. Our HR Manager really loves her little boy. His name is Chris.

5. Don't fuck this up.

We're were very honored to have you work for us. But as a

you go. We wish you luck and you should recieve your final
check by the end of the week. Thank you.

From: Amitav Gutipaty
What?! Bullshit!!!! if the whole shit about the economy is
true, then you wouldn't be hiring more motherfucking security
consultants! I just trained that stupid little jerk-off and
now you're firing me? FUCk you! and all your shit. I'm gonna
go work for Google....fuck you and Pheonixeon.

To: Amitav Gutipaty
Please refrain from using vulgar language. And both of those
consultants will make less than what you make. I will ask
that you train this new recruit as well before you leave. Thanks :)
